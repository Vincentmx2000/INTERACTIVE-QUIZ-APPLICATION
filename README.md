INTERACTIVE-QUIZ-APPLICATION:

The QUIZ APPLICATION is a fully interactive and engaging web-based quiz application that I built using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. What started as a basic quiz turned into a polished and fun experience with added features like category selection, score tracking, high score storage, random answer shuffling, and even a dark mode toggle.The idea behind this project was to create something lightweight and enjoyable, where users can test their general knowledge or science skills in a clean, responsive interface. When a user first opens the app, they're greeted with a bright welcome screen that allows them to pick a quiz category—either General Knowledge, Science, or All. This not only makes the quiz more flexible but also gives users a sense of control over what they want to learn or practice.
Once a category is selected, the quiz begins. Each question appears one at a time with four multiple-choice options. The answers are shuffled randomly every time to make the quiz unpredictable and fair. When a user selects an answer, the app instantly provides feedback: a green highlight and a “Correct!” message for right answers, and a red highlight with the correct answer shown for wrong ones. The background color also changes briefly, which adds to the interactivity and visual appeal.A progress indicator at the top of each quiz screen tells users which question they’re currently on—like “Question 3 of 10.” This small addition really helps with pacing and makes the user feel more aware of their progress. After all the questions are answered, the app switches to a result screen that displays the final score, a breakdown of correct and incorrect answers, and the overall percentage.One of the cooler features is the high score tracker. The app saves your highest score locally using the browser’s local storage, so even if you refresh the page or come back later, it remembers your best performance. It’s a small touch, but it adds a bit of a competitive edge and motivates users to beat their previous score.

To make the experience more inclusive and user-friendly, I also added a dark mode toggle. With just one click, users can switch between light and dark themes depending on their preference or environment. All UI elements respond smoothly to the theme switch, keeping the design consistent and pleasant to look at.The entire app is mobile-friendly and responsive, thanks to media queries and a clean layout structure. Whether it’s being accessed from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the user experience remains smooth and intuitive. The use of colors, hover effects, and transitions keeps the app lively without overwhelming the user.

 Tools & Technologies Used:

HTML – for structuring the content
CSS – for styling, animations, and responsiveness
JavaScript – for quiz logic, interactivity, score tracking, and DOM manipulation
LocalStorage API – to store and display the high score

This project has been a really fun and rewarding learning experience. It taught me how to combine clean design with smart logic, and how little things like randomizing answers or showing real-time feedback can go a long way in making a web app feel polished and complete. There’s still room to grow—maybe by adding sound effects, a backend for saving user data, or more categories—but for now, I’m proud of how functional and fun it is.
